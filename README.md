# 🎮 Tic Tac Toe in Java – Player vs Player (Winter 2023)

This repository contains a terminal-based **Tic Tac Toe** game written in **Java**, created as a personal project during **Winter 2023**. The current version supports **Player vs Player** mode in the console, and serves as a foundation for future improvements — including **Player vs Computer** mode and a full **GUI version**.

It's part of my coding portfolio and is featured on my CV to showcase my Java development skills and personal learning journey.

## 🏆 Highlights

- ✅ Developed from scratch in Java using OOP principles
- 👥 Supports 2-player gameplay via console
- 📦 Clean and modular codebase
- 🚧 Upcoming improvements: Player vs AI and GUI version

## 💼 Key Skills Demonstrated

- Java (OOP, class-based architecture)
- Game logic (win conditions, draws, turn order)
- Terminal I/O and user input handling
- State management using objects and control flow
- Planning future features and improvements

  ## 🧠 What I Learned

Through this project, I:

- Strengthened my understanding of Java fundamentals and OOP
- Learned how to manage game flow and user interaction via the console
- Planned for future improvements with AI and GUI integration
- Practiced writing clean, maintainable code in a real-world context

🌱 Planned Improvements
 Add Player vs Computer mode with basic AI (minimax or rule-based)

 Build a GUI version using Swing or JavaFX

 Add win/loss statistics tracking and reset option

📌 Project Context
This project was built outside of formal coursework as part of my personal development during Winter 2023. It reflects my motivation to explore game development, AI logic, and Java UI design in my own time.

⭐ Thanks for checking out my project! Stay tuned for future updates as I expand this into a full-featured, GUI-based Java game with AI support.
